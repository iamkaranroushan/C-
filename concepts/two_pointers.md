two pointers approach:

this is a technique of solving problem involving comparisons, pairs, or symmetrical structures.


we make two pointers or indices :
can be in opposite direction or both in same directions.


steps:

initialize the two pointers left and right 

If the condition holds true we move the pointer.

pointer stop moving when they met each other or a conditions met.

It is used in problems like subarray, string 
manipulation and pair searching.
